# Heap Memory Manager

## Overview

This project implements a custom Heap Memory Manager (HMM) in C, designed to provide dynamic memory allocation services to user-space programs without relying on kernel-level functions like `sbrk()`. Instead, the HMM operates entirely in user space, simulating the heap using a statically allocated array. This approach allows for easy debugging and flexibility during development.

## Features

- **Custom Memory Allocation:** The function `void *HmmAlloc(size_t size)` is provided to allocate memory blocks of the specified size.
- **Custom Memory Deallocation:** The function `void HmmFree(void *ptr)` is provided to free the allocated memory using the pointer returned by `HmmAlloc()`.
- **Simulated Heap Management:** The heap is simulated using a large, statically allocated array, with a variable simulating the program break pointer.
- **Dynamic Heap Adjustment:** The simulated heap size can be increased or decreased by adjusting the program break variable, mimicking the behavior of `sbrk()`.

## How It Works

1. **Static Array Simulation:** A large statically allocated array is used to simulate the heap. This array represents the memory available for allocation.
2. **Program Break Simulation:** A variable is used to simulate the program break. Initially, it points to the beginning of the static array, and it is adjusted as memory is allocated or freed.
   - To increase the heap size, the program break is incremented.
   - To decrease the heap size, the program break is decremented.
3. **Memory Allocation and Deallocation:** 
   - `HmmAlloc(size_t size)` allocates a block of memory by advancing the program break.
   - `HmmFree(void *ptr)` deallocates a block by marking it as free in the simulated heap.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C Compiler (e.g., `gcc`)

### Compilation

To compile the project, run:

```bash
gcc -o hmm hmm.c
```

### Usage

You can use the following functions in your user-space programs:

```c
void *HmmAlloc(size_t size); // Allocates a memory block
void HmmFree(void *ptr);     // Frees a memory block
```

### Example

```c
#include "heap_memory_manager.h"

int main() {
    int *array = (int *)HmmAlloc(10 * sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory for 10 integers
    HmmFree(array); // Free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add error handling for out-of-memory conditions.
- Optimize memory management strategies for fragmentation and coalescing free blocks.
- Implement a more sophisticated memory allocation algorithm (e.g., best fit, first fit).

Data Structures

    BlockHeader Structure:
        size: Size of the allocated block (excluding the header).
        next: Pointer to the next block in the free list.
        free: Flag indicating if the block is free (1) or allocated (0).

    Heap:
        A statically allocated array (heap) simulates the heap space.
        The program_break pointer simulates the program break, initially pointing to the start of the heap.

Constants and Macros

    HEAP_SIZE: Defines the total size of the simulated heap (200 MB).
    HEADER_SIZE: The size of the block header.
    ALIGN(x): Macro to align the requested size to the systemâ€™s word size.


Function Descriptions

    - void *HmmAlloc(size_t size):
        Allocates a block of memory of the specified size.
        Returns a pointer to the allocated memory or NULL if allocation fails.

    - void HmmFree(void *ptr):
        Frees a previously allocated block of memory.
        Adds the freed block to the free list and merges adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.

    - BlockHeader *find_free_block(size_t size):
        Finds a suitable free block in the free list that can accommodate the requested size.
        If no suitable block is found, attempts to extend the heap.

    - void split_block(BlockHeader *block, size_t size):
        Splits a larger block into two if the requested size is smaller than the block size.

    - void add_to_free_list(BlockHeader *block):
        Adds a freed block to the beginning of the free list.

    - void merge_free_blocks():
        Merges consecutive free blocks into a single larger block to reduce fragmentation.

Constants

    NUM_ALLOCATIONS: The number of memory allocations to perform (100).
    MAX_ALLOCATION_SIZE: The maximum size of each memory allocation (64KB).

External Functions

    void *HmmAlloc(size_t size): Allocates memory of the specified size using the custom Heap Memory Manager.
    void HmmFree(void *ptr): Frees the previously allocated memory block.

Functionality

    Randomized Allocation and Deallocation:
        The program performs 100 iterations where it randomly decides to either allocate or free memory with a 50% chance for each action.
        If allocation is chosen, a random size between 1 and MAX_ALLOCATION_SIZE is generated, and HmmAlloc is called to allocate the memory. If successful, the allocated pointer is stored; otherwise, an error message is printed.
        If deallocation is chosen, a random index from the allocations array is selected. If the pointer at that index is not NULL, the block is freed using HmmFree.

    Memory Cleanup:
        After the random operations, any remaining allocated memory blocks are freed to avoid memory leaks.
